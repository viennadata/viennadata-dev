\chapter{Use Cases} \label{chap:use-cases}
In this chapter we discuss two use-cases for {\ViennaData}. The two use-cases are
intentionally chosen to be very distinct from each other. The first use-case is
admittedly artificial, since the author of {\ViennaData} has not been involved in
programming computer games yet. The second use-case describes the solution of partial differential equations by means of discretization methods.
Since the author is actively working on the simulation of semiconductor devices, this can be seen as the roots of {\ViennaData}.
